Feedback:
---------
When enemy and player fish sizes are very close, it is hard to figure out which one is bigger,
Making it frustrating if you tried to eat a fish (and lose) because you thought it was smaller than you.

Action Taken:
-------------
Added a red outline to all enemy fish who are bigger than the player
