1. CPI is good - we will add more fish ingame by increasing spawn rate and decreasing fish speed. Decreasing fish speed will make the game easier as well
2. Retention could be better - We will make level 1 (and generally the levels) easier. This means decreasing the total score needed for win condition
   as well as making the probabilities of spawning fish smaller than the player larger, and steadily make the game harder as levels increase
3. We will also add powerUp to tutorial to make it a bit longer and more engaging
