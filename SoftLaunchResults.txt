ACTION TAKEN:
-------------

1. CPI is good 
   Since videos with a lot of fish perfomed better, added more fish ingame by increasing spawn rate 
   and decreasing fish speed. Decreasing fish speed will make the game easier as well

2. Retention could be better - 
   Changed level 1 (and generally the game) to be easier.
   This means decreasing the total score needed for win condition as well as making the probabilities of spawning 
   fish smaller than the player larger, and steadily make the game harder as levels increase

3. Added a pickup power up to tutorial to make it a bit longer and more engaging
